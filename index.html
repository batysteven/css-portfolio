            <p>Hello, my name is Steven Baty. Here is a portfolio I have created to show off my accomplishments and applications I have worked very hard on! For a little info about me, I married my best friend in June of 2016. The wedding was where we first met up at Bear Lake, a very cute beach wedding! We have two very adorable fur babies and live in a modest first home. I have just completed a coding bootcamp through University of Utah for Full Stack Web Developer. I am very proud of myself and how far I have come during this process. 

                I am looking to start a career instead of just having a job. I'm a very hard worker who is extremely eager to learn! I work very well in teams and can't wait to learn from and assist my future co-workers! I'm a very dedicated worker who loves to solve problems and search for solutions. Please enjoy looking through my completed work so far.
            </p>
